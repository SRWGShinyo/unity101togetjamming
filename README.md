# Learn Unity and Game Jamming

## Foreword

This repository aims at allowing to learn unity basics quickly for game jaming, and also give interested people a way to learn game jamming.
It is free to use, however, please, if you use my slides, let the credit slide or credit me !

## Project

In this set of slides, the learner will also create a little game. The assets for this game are found in the 'MiniProject - Resources' folder.

A full version of the project can be found in the 'MiniProjectUnity101' folder. It is however recommended to try and do the project before reading the 'correction'.

Project was done in Unity 2020.3.23f1, and the slides written in July 2022. I will try to keep everything running and up to date, but there might be latency on that point.
